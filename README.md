# Getting Started
The deployment consists of various CloudFormation templates that are deployed and teared down using the [Terraform Provider for AWS](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-aws):
  * `private-vpc.yaml`: Deploys containerized applications onto a cluster of EC2 hosts using Elastic Container Service. This stack runs containers on   hosts that are in a private VPC subnet. Outbound network traffic from the
  hosts must go out through a NAT gateway.
  * `efs-service.yaml`: Deploys an EFS file system with the appropriate folder mounts required for Prestashop ECS Containers.
  * `rds-service.yaml`: Deploys an RDS MariaDB instance that Prestashop will use. Multi-AZ is disabled by default.
  * `ec2-service.yaml`: Deploys an EC2 AutoScaling Groups, Public Load balancer, and Security Groups required for the entire deployment.
  * `ecs-service.yaml`: Deploys an elastic container service that will run Prestashop containers on registered instances in our cluster.
  * `service-autoscaling.yaml`: A stack for configuring autoscaling between the EC2 ASG and ECS Service using CloudWatch alarms.
